# Proactive Triggers

Proactively offer assistance to users based on their behavior, even before they ask for help.

<Info>
  Proactive triggers require **Pro** or **Enterprise** plan.

## What Are Proactive Triggers?

Proactive triggers let your bot:

- Monitor for specific patterns or behaviors
- Automatically offer relevant help
- Engage users before they open tickets
- Reduce support volume with preemptive assistance

## How It Works

```

Pattern Detected
     ↓
Trigger Condition Met
     ↓
Proactive Response Sent
     ↓

### Response Timing

Configure when response is sent:

- **Immediate**: Right after trigger
- **Delayed**: Wait X seconds
- **Quiet hours**: Different behavior outside hours

## Advanced Options

### Conditions

Combine multiple conditions:

```
IF message contains "error"
AND user is new member (joined < 7 days)
AND channel is #general
THEN send help response
```

### User Filters

Trigger only for certain users:

| Filter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **New Members** | Joined recently |
| **No Roles** | Members without roles |
| **Specific Roles** | Has certain role |
| **Exclude Staff** | Don't trigger for staff |

### Context Awareness

Consider conversation context:

- Respect ongoing support interactions

|--------|-------------|
| **Times Triggered** | How often it fires |
| **Helpful Rate** | User engagement |
| **Ticket Prevention** | Tickets avoided |

### Optimization

Use analytics to improve:

- Adjust keywords if too many false positives
- Improve responses if low engagement
- Remove ineffective triggers

## Best Practices
