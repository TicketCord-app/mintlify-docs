description: "Teach your bot from historical ticket conversations"

The `/train` command lets you teach your bot from past ticket conversations. It analyzes resolved tickets and extracts question-answer pairs that are added to your Knowledge Base.

<Info>
  The `/train` command requires a **Pro** or **Enterprise** plan.
</Info>

## What It Does

The `/train` command:
1. Scans your resolved tickets from the past X days
2. Uses AI to identify question-answer pairs
3. Extracts the best Q&A from each conversation
4. Adds them to your Knowledge Base automatically

This captures the "tribal knowledge" your team has built up - answers to common questions that may not be in your documentation.

## Running /train

### Basic Usage

In any channel where your bot is active, run:

```
/train
```

The bot will analyze tickets from the last 90 days (default).

### Specifying Days

To analyze a different time period:

```
/train days:30
```

This analyzes tickets from the last 30 days.

| Parameter | Range | Default |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| days | 7-365 | 90 |

<Tip>
  Start with 30-60 days to test. Increase to 90+ once you're confident it's working well.
</Tip>

### Requirements

To run `/train`, you need:
- **Administrator** permission in the server
- Knowledge Base **enabled** in your dashboard
- At least one **resolved** ticket in the time period

## The Training Process

After running `/train`, you'll see:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Counting Tickets">
    The bot counts how many tickets are available to analyze.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Analyzing Conversations">
    AI reads through each ticket conversation, looking for:
    - Clear questions from users
    - Helpful answers from staff
    - Complete resolution patterns
  </Step>
  <Step title="Extracting Q&A Pairs">
    The AI extracts question-answer pairs that would help future users.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adding to Knowledge Base">
    Extracted Q&A pairs are stored and used for future suggestions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Progress Updates

While training, you'll see updates like:

```
🤖 Training in Progress
Analyzing stored tickets from the last 90 days...

📊 Progress: 15/42 tickets (35%)
✅ Extracted: 8 Q&A pairs

[Cancel Training]
```

### Cancelling Training

Click the **Cancel Training** button to stop training early. Any Q&A pairs already extracted will be kept.

## First-Time Setup

### AI Consent

The first time you run `/train`, you'll need to accept AI data processing terms.

**Why is this required?**
- Ticket conversations are sent to AI for analysis
- This may include user messages and staff responses
- You're authorizing this processing

<Warning>
  Only the **bot owner** can accept AI consent terms. If you're not the owner, ask them to run `/train` first.
</Warning>

### Consent Prompt

You'll see:

```
📋 AI Data Processing Consent Required

To use /train, we need your consent to process ticket conversations with AI.

What happens:
• Ticket messages are analyzed to extract Q&A pairs
• AI learns from staff responses to help future users
• Data is processed securely and not shared

[Accept] [Decline]
```

Click **Accept** to proceed, or **Decline** to cancel.

## What Makes Good Training Data

The AI looks for tickets that have:

### Clear Questions

```
User: How do I cancel my subscription?
```

### Helpful Answers

```
Staff: Go to Settings → Subscription → Cancel. 
       Your access continues until the billing period ends.
```

### Complete Resolution

Tickets that were marked as resolved or closed with a solution.

## What Gets Skipped

The AI skips tickets that:
- Were closed without a real solution
- Had mostly back-and-forth troubleshooting
- Contained only small talk or greetings
- Were spam or test tickets

## After Training

### Viewing Results

After training completes, you'll see:

```
✅ Training Complete!

📊 Results:
• Tickets analyzed: 42
• Q&A pairs extracted: 12
• Tokens used: 150K

Your bot is now smarter! New Q&A will be used in future suggestions.
```

### Using Trained Knowledge

Trained Q&A pairs are automatically used when:
- Users open new tickets with similar questions
- The Knowledge Base searches for answers
- No better documentation source exists

### Retraining

You can run `/train` again to:
- Capture newer ticket conversations
- Learn from recently resolved issues
- Update knowledge after your team's processes change

<Info>
  There's a cooldown between training runs to prevent overuse. You'll see how long to wait if you try to train too soon.
</Info>

## Best Practices

### Train After Major Updates

Run `/train` after:
- Launching new features
- Resolving new types of issues
- Your team learns new troubleshooting steps

### Combine with Documentation

`/train` works best alongside documentation sources:
- Documentation provides official information
- Trained Q&A provides real-world answers
- Together they cover more questions

### Regular Training Schedule

Consider training:
- Monthly for active support teams
- After resolving 50+ new tickets
- When you notice AI missing common questions

### Review the Results

Check your Knowledge Base after training:
- Look at the extracted Q&A pairs
- Verify they're accurate
- Delete any that aren't helpful

## Troubleshooting

### "No Tickets Found"

This means:
- No resolved tickets in the time period
- Tickets don't have enough content
- Knowledge Base isn't enabled

**Solution:** Check that you have resolved tickets and Knowledge Base is enabled.

### "Training Stalled"

If training shows no progress for 5+ minutes:
- The process may have encountered an error
- Try cancelling and running again
- Check for bot connectivity issues

### "Consent Required" for Non-Owner

Only the bot owner can accept AI consent.

**Solution:** Ask the bot owner to run `/train` first and accept consent.

### Low Q&A Extraction

If few Q&A pairs are extracted:
- Tickets may not have clear question-answer patterns
- Staff responses may be too brief
- Try a longer time period (more tickets)
