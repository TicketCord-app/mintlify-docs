## AI Response Settings

### Response Style

Control how detailed AI suggestions should be:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Concise">
    Short, to-the-point answers. Best for:
    - Simple yes/no questions
    - Quick reference information
    - Experienced users who want fast answers

    **Example:**
    > "Yes, you can cancel anytime from Settings → Subscription → Cancel."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Balanced (Recommended)">
    Mix of context and actionable steps. Best for:
    - Most support scenarios
    - When users need guidance but not hand-holding
    - General-purpose support

    **Example:**
    > "You can cancel your subscription at any time. Go to Settings → Subscription → Cancel. Your access continues until the end of your billing period."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Helpful">
    Detailed explanations with extra context. Best for:
    - Complex features
    - New users who need more guidance
    - When detailed steps are important

    **Example:**
    > "You can cancel your subscription at any time without penalty. Here's how:
    > 1. Click the gear icon to open Settings
    > 2. Select 'Subscription' from the menu
    > 3. Click 'Cancel Subscription'
    > 4. You'll keep access until your billing period ends on [date]
    >
    > If you change your mind, you can resubscribe anytime."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Confidence Threshold

The minimum confidence level before showing a suggestion.

| Threshold | What Happens |
|-----------|--------------|
| **High (70%+)** | Only shows answers the AI is very confident about. Fewer suggestions, but more accurate. |
| **Medium (50-70%)** | Shows more suggestions. Some may be less accurate. |
| **Low (below 50%)** | Shows many suggestions. Higher chance of irrelevant answers. |

<Tip>
  Start at 70% (default). Lower it if users aren't getting suggestions, raise it if suggestions are often wrong.
</Tip>

### Max Response Tokens

Limits how long AI responses can be. The default (2000 tokens) allows for complete, detailed answers.

- **Lower values** (500-1000): Shorter, more concise answers
- **Higher values** (2000+): Longer, more detailed answers

<Info>
  1 token ≈ 4 characters. 2000 tokens ≈ 1500 words maximum.
</Info>

## Trigger Settings

Control when the bot provides suggestions.

### On Ticket Creation

When enabled, the bot reads the user's initial message and immediately suggests relevant answers.

**Best for:**
- Most support setups
- Providing instant help
- Reducing time-to-first-response

### Trigger Keywords

Add specific words that trigger Knowledge Base searches:

**Example keywords:**
- `help`, `how do I`, `can I`
- Product-specific terms like `refund`, `upgrade`, `cancel`

Leave empty to trigger on all messages.

### Delay Before Suggestion

Wait time (in seconds) before the bot sends a suggestion. Default is 2 seconds.

**Why use a delay:**
- Gives users time to send follow-up messages
- Prevents spam-like rapid responses
- Allows message batching for multi-message questions

**Settings:**
- **0 seconds** - Immediate response (may interrupt users)
- **2-5 seconds** - Recommended for most setups
- **10+ seconds** - For slower-paced support

### Minimum Message Length

Only trigger on messages with at least this many characters. Default is 10.

**Why use this:**
- Ignores greetings like "hi" or "hello"
- Focuses on actual questions
- Reduces unnecessary AI calls

**Recommended settings:**
- **10 characters** - Captures "What is X?" style questions
- **20+ characters** - Only triggers on detailed questions

## Behavior Settings

### Stop After Staff Response

When enabled, the bot stops suggesting answers once a staff member replies.

**When to use:**
- Staff prefers to handle tickets without AI help
- To prevent AI from contradicting staff
- For complex issues that need human judgment

**When to disable:**
- AI should continue helping during long conversations
- Staff uses AI as a tool to find information

### Respect Staff Presence

When enabled, the bot backs off for 5 minutes after staff sends a message.

**How it works:**
1. Staff sends a message
2. Bot pauses suggestions for 5 minutes
3. If user asks again after 5 minutes, bot can suggest

**When to use:**
- Staff is actively helping and doesn't want interruption
- AI should only help when staff is idle

### Outside Business Hours Only

When enabled, AI only suggests answers outside your configured business hours.

**When to use:**
- Human-first support during work hours
- AI coverage for after-hours tickets
- Weekend/holiday coverage

<Info>
  Configure your business hours in **Server Settings** → **Automation** → **Business Hours**.
</Info>

## Display Settings

### Show Source Info

When enabled, suggestions include:
- The source title (e.g., "From: FAQ Page")
- A link to the original page

**When to enable:**
- Users want to read more details
- Transparency is important
- You want users to explore documentation

**When to disable:**
- Cleaner, simpler suggestions
- You prefer users to stay in Discord

### Show Confidence Score

When enabled, suggestions show the AI's confidence percentage.

**Example with confidence:**
> 💡 **Suggestion** (87% confident)
> You can cancel anytime from Settings...

**When to enable:**
- Users should know how reliable the answer is
- Training staff to recognize AI limitations
- Debugging suggestion quality

**When to disable:**
- Cleaner appearance
- Users don't need technical details
