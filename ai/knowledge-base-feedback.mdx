The feedback system lets users rate AI suggestions, and optionally allows your bot to learn and improve based on those ratings.

## How Feedback Works

When your bot suggests an answer, users see vote buttons:

```
💡 Suggestion
Here's how to reset your password...

[👍 Helpful] [👎 Not Helpful]
```

When users click:
- **👍 Helpful** - Records positive feedback
- **👎 Not Helpful** - Records negative feedback

This data helps you understand which content works well and which needs improvement.

## Enabling Feedback

1. Go to **AI Features** → **Knowledge Base** → **Feedback**
2. Toggle **Enable Feedback** on
3. Save your settings

<Info>
  Feedback is enabled by default for new Knowledge Base setups.
</Info>

## Feedback Settings

### Staff Only Voting

When enabled, only staff members can vote on suggestions.

**When to use:**
- Staff opinions are more valuable
- Prevent spam voting from users
- Train the system based on expert judgment

**When to disable:**
- All feedback is valuable
- Users know when answers help them
- You want broader feedback data

### Self-Learning

When enabled, the bot automatically adjusts content ranking based on votes.

**How it works:**
1. Content gets votes over time
2. After reaching the minimum votes threshold (default: 3)
3. High-rated content gets boosted (shown more often)
4. Low-rated content gets penalized (shown less often)

**Settings you can adjust:**

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Min Votes for Learning | 3 | Votes needed before learning applies |
| Good Content Threshold | 70% | Success rate to trigger boost |
| Poor Content Threshold | 40% | Success rate to trigger penalty |
| Boost Percentage | 15% | How much to boost good content |
| Penalty Percentage | 15% | How much to penalize poor content |

<Tip>
  Start with defaults. Adjust if you notice the system learning too aggressively or too slowly.
</Tip>

### AI Disclaimer

When enabled, suggestions include a note that the response was AI-generated:

> 🤖 *This response was generated by AI and may not be 100% accurate.*

**When to enable:**
- Transparency is important to your users
- Users should verify important information
- You're in an industry that requires disclaimers

**When to disable:**
- Cleaner appearance
- Users don't need the reminder
- You've validated all your sources

## Auto-Escalation

When the AI doesn't have a confident answer, it can automatically alert your team.

### How It Works

1. User asks a question
2. AI searches Knowledge Base
3. If confidence is too low, AI triggers escalation
4. Staff gets notified
5. User sees a message that human help is coming

### Settings

**Auto-Escalate on Low Confidence**

Toggle this on to enable escalation when AI can't find good answers.

**Ping Staff on Escalation**

When enabled, the bot will ping your staff role when escalating.

<Warning>
  Make sure you have a staff role configured in your server settings.
</Warning>

**Escalation Batch Window**

Wait time before sending escalation notification (in seconds):
- **0** - Immediate notification
- **30** - Wait 30 seconds (default, allows user to provide more context)
- **Up to 300** - Wait up to 5 minutes

### Human Assistance Detection

The bot can detect when users specifically ask for human help:

**Phrases that trigger immediate escalation:**
- "I want to talk to a human"
- "Can I speak to a real person?"
- "Human please"
- "Real support"
- Similar variations

When detected, the bot immediately escalates without trying to answer.

**Confidence Threshold**

How confident the AI must be that the user wants human help (default: 80%).

- Higher = fewer false positives, might miss some requests
- Lower = catches more requests, might escalate unnecessarily

## Viewing Feedback Data

In the dashboard, you can see:

### Overview Stats

- Total suggestions given
- Total votes received
- Thumbs up percentage
- Thumbs down percentage

### Source Performance

See how each source performs:
- Which sources get the most positive feedback
- Which sources have problems
- Suggested actions (deprecate, update, etc.)

### Problem Areas

Identify content that needs attention:
- Low success rate chunks
- Common feedback reasons (incorrect, outdated, not relevant)
- Suggestions for improvement

## Improving Based on Feedback

### Content With Low Ratings

If content consistently gets thumbs down:

1. **Check the source** - Is the documentation accurate and up-to-date?
2. **Read the feedback** - What are users saying is wrong?
3. **Update or remove** - Fix the content or delete the source

### Content With High Ratings

If content consistently gets thumbs up:

1. **Add similar content** - What makes this content work well?
2. **Use as a template** - Follow the same format for new content
3. **Consider priority boost** - Increase the source priority

### Persistent Issues

If the same questions keep getting bad ratings:

1. **Check if answer exists** - Maybe you need new documentation
2. **Improve the content** - Make it clearer or more complete
3. **Consider categories** - Maybe the wrong source is being used

## Best Practices

### Review Feedback Regularly

Check your feedback stats weekly to catch issues early:
- Sudden drops in success rate
- New problem areas
- Sources that need updates

### Enable Self-Learning Carefully

Self-learning works best with:
- High-quality documentation
- Enough feedback data (at least 50+ votes total)
- Regular monitoring

Start with it disabled, enable once you're confident in your sources.

### Use Escalation for Complex Topics

Some questions shouldn't have AI answers:
- Billing disputes
- Account security issues
- Complex technical problems

Set up category restrictions so AI doesn't answer sensitive tickets, and enable escalation for those categories.
