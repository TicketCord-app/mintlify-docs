description: "Automatically set ticket priority based on content and urgency"
---

Priority Detection uses AI to analyze ticket content and automatically assign a priority level. Urgent issues get flagged immediately, while routine questions stay at normal priority.

<Info>
  Priority Detection is a **Pro** feature. [Upgrade your plan](https://ticketcord.net/pricing) to access it.
</Info>

## How It Works

1. User opens a ticket or sends a message
2. AI analyzes the content for urgency signals
3. AI assigns a priority: Low, Medium, High, or Critical
4. The ticket channel name and/or staff are updated

**Example:**
> User: "Our entire team can't access the platform and we have a client demo in 30 minutes!"

AI detects urgency ("can't access", "entire team", "30 minutes") and sets **Critical** priority.

## Priority Levels

| Priority | When Used | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Low** | General questions, no urgency | "What are your business hours?" |
| **Medium** | Standard issues, normal handling | "I need help resetting my password" |
| **High** | Significant impact or frustration | "This feature stopped working today" |
| **Critical** | Urgent, time-sensitive, major impact | "System is down, losing revenue" |

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Priority Detection">
    Go to **AI Features** → **Priority Detection** and toggle it on.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Settings">

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Settings

### Analysis Mode

Choose when AI analyzes for priority:

| Mode | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **First Message** | Analyze immediately | Quick prioritization |
| **First 3 Messages** | Wait for more context | Better accuracy |
| **Smart Detection** | AI decides timing | Recommended |

<Tip>
  **Smart Detection** recognizes urgency keywords and analyzes quickly for those, while waiting for more context on ambiguous tickets.
</Tip>

### Delay Before Analysis

How long to wait before analyzing (in seconds):
- **0** - Immediate (may interrupt user typing)
- **15-30** - Recommended (lets user finish)
- **60+** - For multi-message context

### Confidence Threshold

Minimum AI confidence before setting priority:
- **70%+ (default)** - Only set when confident
- **50-70%** - Set priority more often
- **Below 50%** - May be inaccurate

### Auto-Update Channel Name

When enabled, the bot adds a priority indicator to the ticket channel name:

```
🔴 ticket-12345-john     (Critical)
🟠 ticket-12346-jane     (High)
🟡 ticket-12347-mike     (Medium)
🟢 ticket-12348-sara     (Low)
```

<Info>
  This gives your team an instant visual indicator of ticket priority.
</Info>

### Notify Staff

When enabled, the bot pings your staff role when a high or critical priority ticket is detected.

### Override Existing

When enabled, AI can change the priority even if one was already set:
- **Enabled** - AI always updates priority
- **Disabled** - AI only sets priority if none exists

## What AI Looks For

The AI analyzes several signals:

### Urgency Words

Words that suggest time pressure:
- "urgent", "ASAP", "immediately", "right now"
- "deadline", "time-sensitive", "critical"
- Specific times: "in 30 minutes", "by tomorrow"

### Impact Words

Words that suggest significant consequences:
- "entire team", "all users", "everyone"
- "can't work", "completely broken", "major issue"
- "losing money", "losing customers"

### Emotional Signals

Signs of frustration or stress:
- Multiple exclamation marks
- ALL CAPS sections
- Expressions of frustration

### Context Clues

Business context that adds urgency:
- Mentions of clients, demos, presentations
- References to revenue or contracts
- Time-sensitive events

## Accuracy Tips

### Be Clear About Urgency

AI works best when users clearly express urgency:
- ✅ "This is urgent - our payment system is down"
- ❌ "Hey, payment isn't working" (could be urgent or not)

### Use Ticket Forms

Add a priority field to your ticket forms:
- Users can self-select priority
- AI uses this as additional context
- Reduces missed urgent tickets

### Review and Adjust

Check AI accuracy regularly:
- Are critical tickets being flagged?
- Are routine tickets staying low priority?
- Adjust confidence threshold based on results

## Combining with Other Features

Priority Detection works well with:

### Auto-Routing

Route high-priority tickets to senior staff:
```
Priority: High or Critical → Senior Support category
```

### SLA Management

Set faster response times for higher priorities:
```
Critical: 15 minutes
High: 1 hour
Medium: 4 hours
Low: 24 hours
```

### Sentiment Detection

Combine priority with sentiment for better routing:
```
High Priority + Angry Sentiment → Escalation team
```

## Troubleshooting

### Priority Not Being Set

1. **Check if enabled** - Verify Priority Detection is on
2. **Check confidence** - Lower the threshold if needed
3. **Check analysis mode** - "Smart Detection" may wait longer

### Wrong Priority Assigned

1. **Check content** - Does the message clearly indicate urgency?
2. **Adjust confidence** - Raise threshold for more accuracy
3. **Use ticket forms** - Let users self-select priority

### Staff Not Being Notified

1. **Check notify setting** - Make sure "Notify Staff" is enabled
2. **Check staff role** - Verify your staff role is configured
3. **Check priority** - Notifications only trigger for High/Critical
