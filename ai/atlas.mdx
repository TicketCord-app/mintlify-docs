## Example Questions

### Ticket Information

```
"Show me ticket #42"
"What's the status of John's latest ticket?"
"Find tickets about billing from last week"
"How many tickets are currently open?"
```

### Analytics

```
"What's our average response time this month?"
"How many tickets did we resolve this week?"
"What's our busiest day for tickets?"
"Show ticket volume trends for the past 30 days"
```

### Staff Performance

```
"Who resolved the most tickets this week?"
"What's Sarah's average response time?"
"Which staff member handles billing tickets?"
"Show staff performance for the past month"
```

### Bot Performance

```
"How is my support bot performing?"
"Compare activity across all my bots"
"Which server has the most tickets?"
"Show bot performance metrics"
```

## Referencing Tickets

You can reference specific tickets using `@ticket:ID`:

```
Tell me about @ticket:42
What was the resolution for @ticket:123?
```

As you type `@ticket:`, Atlas suggests recent tickets you can select.

## Sessions

Atlas remembers your conversation within a session:

```
You: "Show me open billing tickets"
Atlas: [Shows 5 billing tickets]
You: "Which one has been waiting longest?"
Atlas: [Knows you mean billing tickets]
```

## Best Practices

### Be Specific

Specific questions get better answers:
- ✅ "What was our response time for billing tickets last week?"
- ❌ "How are we doing?"

### Use Time Ranges

Specify time periods for better results:
- "This week", "Last month", "Past 30 days"
- "Since January", "In Q4"

### Reference Context

Use ticket IDs and staff names when possible:
- "@ticket:123"
- "Sarah's performance"
- "Billing category"

### Ask Follow-Ups

Atlas remembers context, so follow up naturally:
```
"Show me unresolved tickets"
"Which one is highest priority?"
"What's the history on that one?"
```

## Data Security

Atlas only accesses data you own:
- Your bots only
- Your servers only
- No access to other users' data

All queries are:
- Authenticated with your session
- Limited to your bot IDs
- Read-only (cannot modify data)

## Token Usage

Atlas queries use AI tokens:
- Simple questions: ~500-1,000 tokens
- Complex analytics: ~2,000-3,000 tokens
- Ticket lookups: ~500-1,500 tokens

<Tip>
  Token usage is shown after each response so you can monitor consumption.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### "No data found"

1. **Check bot selection** - Make sure the right bot is selected
2. **Check time range** - Expand the time period
3. **Check criteria** - Your filters might be too narrow

### Slow Responses

1. **Complex queries** - Large data requests take longer
2. **Ticket history** - Full conversations are data-intensive
3. **Be patient** - Atlas shows progress while working

### Wrong Information

1. **Clarify question** - Be more specific
2. **Check context** - Atlas might be using previous context
3. **Start new session** - Clear context if needed

### Can't Find Tickets

1. **Check ticket ID** - Verify the number is correct
2. **Check ownership** - Ticket must be from your bot
3. **Check access** - You need access to the server
