Auto-Routing uses AI to analyze ticket content and automatically move tickets to the appropriate category. No more manual sorting - the bot handles it for you.

<Info>
  Auto-Routing is a **Pro** feature. [Upgrade your plan](https://ticketcord.net/pricing) to access it.
</Info>

## How It Works

1. User opens a ticket
2. AI reads the message content
3. AI matches content against your routing rules
4. Ticket is automatically moved to the right category

**Example:**
> User: "I need a refund for my last purchase"

AI detects "refund" and moves the ticket to your "Billing" category.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Auto-Routing">
    Go to **AI Features** → **Auto-Routing** and toggle it on.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Routing Rules">
    Click **Add Rule** and define what triggers the route and where tickets should go.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test It">
    Open a test ticket with content that matches your rule to verify it works.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Analysis Modes

Choose when the AI analyzes tickets:

| Mode | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **First Message Only** | Analyze immediately after the first message | Fast routing, simple tickets |
| **First 3 Messages** | Wait for up to 3 messages before analyzing | More context, better accuracy |
| **First 5 Messages** | Wait for up to 5 messages | Complex tickets needing more context |
| **Smart Detection** | AI decides when it has enough context | Recommended for most setups |

<Tip>
  **Smart Detection** is recommended - it balances speed with accuracy by waiting only when needed.
</Tip>

## Creating Routing Rules

Each rule has three parts:
1. **Triggers** - What to look for
2. **Conditions** - Specific criteria to match
3. **Actions** - What to do when matched

### Triggers

You can trigger routing based on:

| Trigger | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Keywords** | Specific words or phrases | "refund", "payment", "bug" |
| **Topic** | General topic categories | billing, technical, general |
| **Sentiment** | User's emotional state | angry, frustrated, confused |
| **Urgency** | How urgent the request seems | low, medium, high, critical |
| **Language** | Detected language | English, Spanish, French |

### Conditions

Set specific criteria for each trigger:

**Keywords Example:**
```
Keywords: refund, payment failed, charge, billing
```

**Sentiment Example:**
```
Sentiments: angry, frustrated
→ Route to senior support
```

**Topic Example:**
```
Topics: bug_report, technical
→ Route to Technical Support category
```

### Actions

When a rule matches, you can:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Move to Category** | Route ticket to a specific category |
| **Add to Queue** | Add to a priority queue for staff |
| **Notify Staff** | Ping a role when routed |
| **Add Tags** | Automatically tag the ticket |

## Rule Priority

When multiple rules might match, priority determines which one wins:

- Higher priority (1-10) = checked first
- First matching rule is applied
- Lower priority rules are skipped

**Example:**
```
Rule 1 (Priority 10): Keywords "urgent", "emergency" → Critical Support
Rule 2 (Priority 5): Topic "technical" → Technical Support
```

If someone says "urgent technical issue", Rule 1 matches first (higher priority).

## Confidence Threshold

Each rule has a confidence threshold (0-100%):

- **80%+ (High)** - Only route when very confident
- **60-80% (Medium)** - Balance of accuracy and coverage
- **Below 60% (Low)** - Route more often, may be less accurate

<Warning>
  Low confidence thresholds may cause incorrect routing. Start high and lower if needed.
</Warning>

## Fallback Behavior

When no rules match, you can:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **No Action** | Leave ticket in original category |
| **Move to Default** | Route to a fallback category |
| **Notify Staff** | Alert staff to manually review |

## Templates

TicketCord includes pre-built templates for common setups:

### Business Support
Routes based on billing, sales, and support topics.

### SaaS Product
Routes based on bugs, feature requests, and technical issues.

### Community
Routes based on general inquiries, reports, and applications.

<Tip>
  Start with a template and customize it for your needs.
</Tip>

## Delay Before Analysis

You can set a delay (in seconds) before AI analyzes the ticket:

- **0 seconds** - Immediate analysis
- **5-10 seconds** - Wait for user to finish typing
- **30+ seconds** - Wait for follow-up messages

<Info>
  Some users send multiple messages. A short delay lets them finish before routing.
</Info>

```
Trigger: Keywords
Keywords: refund, payment, charge, invoice, billing, subscription

```

## Troubleshooting

### Tickets Not Being Routed

1. **Check if enabled** - Make sure Auto-Routing is toggled on
2. **Check rules** - Verify you have at least one active rule
3. **Check conditions** - Make sure the ticket content matches your triggers
4. **Lower confidence** - Try lowering the confidence threshold

### Wrong Category

1. **Check priority** - Higher priority rules match first
2. **Check conditions** - Make sure conditions aren't too broad
3. **Add specificity** - Use more specific keywords or combinations

### Delayed Routing

1. **Check analysis mode** - "First Message" is fastest
2. **Check delay setting** - Lower the delay before analysis
3. **Check confidence** - Higher confidence may take longer to confirm
