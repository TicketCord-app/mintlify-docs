Duplicate Detection uses AI to identify when multiple tickets are about the same issue. This helps your team avoid duplicate work and provides consistent answers.

<Info>
  Duplicate Detection is a **Pro** feature. [Upgrade your plan](https://ticketcord.net/pricing) to access it.
</Info>

## How It Works

1. User opens a new ticket
2. AI compares it to recent tickets (same user and others)
3. If a similar ticket is found, staff is notified
4. Staff can link or merge the tickets

**Example:**
> User opens Ticket #42: "My payment isn't going through"
>
> User opened Ticket #40 yesterday: "Payment failing on checkout"
>
> AI detects these are likely the same issue and alerts staff.

## Why It Matters

### Avoid Duplicate Work

Without detection, two staff members might work on the same issue independently, wasting time and potentially giving conflicting answers.

### Consistent Answers

When tickets are linked, staff can see previous responses and provide consistent information.

### Faster Resolution

If a similar ticket was already resolved, staff can apply the same solution immediately.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Duplicate Detection">
    Go to **AI Features** → **Duplicate Detection** and toggle it on.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Thresholds">
    Set how confident AI should be before flagging duplicates.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test It">
    Open two tickets with similar content to verify detection works.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Confidence Levels

AI assigns a confidence level to potential duplicates:

| Level | Confidence | What It Means |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| **Very High** | 90%+ | Almost certainly the same issue |
| **High** | 75-90% | Very likely related |
| **Medium** | 60-75% | Possibly related, review recommended |
| **Low** | 45-60% | Might be related, less certain |

<Tip>
  Start with **High** threshold (75%) and adjust based on your experience. Too low = false positives. Too high = missed duplicates.
</Tip>

## Settings

### Confidence Thresholds

Customize the threshold for each confidence level:

```
Very High: 90%+    → Automatically notify
High: 75-90%       → Flag for review
Medium: 60-75%     → Suggest possible match
Low: 45-60%        → Only show on request
```

### Time Window

How far back to search for duplicates:
- **24 hours** - Only very recent tickets
- **7 days** - Recommended for most teams
- **30 days** - For recurring issues

### Scope

What tickets to compare against:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Same User Only** | Only compare tickets from the same user |
| **All Users** | Compare against all recent tickets |
| **Same Category** | Only compare within the same category |

## How Detection Works

### Content Similarity

AI compares the meaning, not just exact words:

```
Ticket A: "My payment isn't working"
Ticket B: "Payment failed at checkout"
→ Detected as similar (same meaning)
```

### Topic Matching

AI understands the general topic:

```
Ticket A: "How do I upgrade my plan?"
Ticket B: "What's the process for upgrading?"
→ Detected as similar (same topic)
```

### User Context

The same user opening multiple tickets is weighted higher:

```
Same user + similar content = likely duplicate
Different users + similar content = might be same issue affecting multiple users
```

## What Staff Sees

When a duplicate is detected, staff sees:

1. **Notification** in the ticket with confidence level
2. **Link** to the potential duplicate ticket
3. **Options** to:
   - View the other ticket
   - Link the tickets
   - Dismiss the suggestion

## Actions

### Link Tickets

Connect two related tickets without merging them:
- Both tickets remain open
- Staff can see they're related
- Good for related but distinct issues

### Dismiss

Mark the suggestion as incorrect:
- AI learns from this feedback
- The suggestion won't appear again
- Use when tickets aren't actually related

## Best Practices

### Review, Don't Auto-Merge

Duplicate detection suggests matches - staff should verify:
- Are they truly the same issue?
- Should they be linked or merged?
- Is additional context needed?

### Use Consistent Subject Lines

Help AI by using clear subject lines:
- ✅ "Payment failing with error code 401"
- ❌ "Help!!!" (hard to match)

### Check Before Creating

Encourage users to check existing tickets:
- Reduces actual duplicates
- Makes detection more accurate
- Improves support efficiency

## Troubleshooting

### Too Many False Positives

If unrelated tickets are being flagged:
1. **Raise threshold** - Increase confidence requirement
2. **Narrow scope** - Check "Same User Only" or "Same Category"
3. **Reduce time window** - Shorten to 24-48 hours

### Missing Obvious Duplicates

If duplicates aren't being detected:
1. **Lower threshold** - Decrease confidence requirement
2. **Expand scope** - Check "All Users"
3. **Extend time window** - Increase to 14-30 days

### Same User, Different Issues

If different issues from the same user are flagged:
1. **Check thresholds** - Make sure "Medium" isn't too low
2. **Review scope** - "Same Category" may help
3. **Train your users** - Encourage clear subject lines
