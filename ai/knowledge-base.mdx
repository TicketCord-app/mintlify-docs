The Knowledge Base lets you connect your documentation, FAQs, or website to your bot. When users open tickets, your bot automatically suggests relevant answers based on what you've taught it.

<Info>
  Knowledge Base is a **Pro** feature. [Upgrade your plan](https://ticketcord.net/pricing) to access it.
</Info>

## How It Works

1. **Add Sources** - Connect your website, documentation, or FAQ pages
2. **Bot Learns** - We scan and understand your content automatically
3. **Auto-Suggest** - When users ask questions, your bot suggests answers from your sources

Your support team doesn't need to type the same answers repeatedly. The bot handles common questions while staff focus on complex issues.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Knowledge Base">
    Go to your bot's dashboard → select your server → **AI Features** → **Knowledge Base**

    Toggle the switch to enable it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a Source">
    Click **Add Source** and enter:
    - **URL** - Link to your documentation page
    - **Title** - A name to identify this source
    - **Type** - Single page or documentation site

    Click **Save** then **Index** to scan the content.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test It">
    Open a test ticket and ask a question that your documentation answers.

    Your bot should suggest an answer within a few seconds.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Source Types

You can add different types of content sources:

| Type | Best For | How It Works |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **Single Page** | FAQ pages, specific guides | Scans one page only |
| **Documentation Site** | Full documentation | Crawls multiple pages (up to 100) |
| **Discord Channel** | Announcements, rules | Indexes messages from a channel |

### Single Page

Use this for standalone pages like:
- FAQ pages
- Pricing pages
- Individual guides or tutorials

The bot scans just that one page and learns from its content.

### Documentation Site

Use this for complete documentation sites. The bot will:
1. Start from your main page
2. Follow links to discover more pages
3. Scan up to 100 pages automatically

<Tip>
  Set the **Crawl Depth** to control how many pages are scanned. Start with 1-2 and increase if needed.
</Tip>

### Discord Channel

Use this to teach your bot from existing Discord content:
- Announcement channels
- Rules channels
- FAQ channels

The bot reads messages from the channel and learns from them.

<Warning>
  Only use public channels. The bot respects Discord permissions and won't access private channels.
</Warning>

## Source Settings

Each source has settings you can customize:

### Update Frequency

How often the bot checks for changes:

| Frequency | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Manual** | Content rarely changes |
| **Daily** | Active documentation with frequent updates |
| **Weekly** | Moderate update frequency |
| **Monthly** | Stable content that rarely changes |

<Info>
  You can always manually re-index a source by clicking the **Refresh** button.
</Info>

### Priority

Sources with higher priority (1-10) are checked first when answering questions. Use this when you have:
- Official documentation (high priority)
- Community guides (lower priority)

### Categories

Assign sources to specific ticket categories. For example:
- Billing documentation → only used for "Billing" tickets
- Technical guides → only used for "Technical Support" tickets

Leave empty to use the source for all tickets.

## AI Settings

Customize how your bot responds to questions.

### Response Style

Choose how detailed AI suggestions should be:

| Style | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Concise** | Short answers that get straight to the point |
| **Balanced** | Mix of context and actionable steps (recommended) |
| **Helpful** | Detailed explanations with extra context |

### Confidence Threshold

The minimum confidence level (0-100%) required before showing a suggestion:

- **70%+ (default)** - Only shows suggestions the AI is confident about
- **50-70%** - Shows more suggestions, but some may be less accurate
- **Below 50%** - Not recommended, may show irrelevant suggestions

<Tip>
  Start with 70% and adjust based on your results. Lower it if the bot isn't suggesting answers often enough.
</Tip>

## Behavior Settings

Control when and how the bot provides suggestions.

### Stop After Staff Response

When enabled, the bot stops suggesting answers once a staff member replies. This prevents the AI from interrupting staff conversations.

### Respect Staff Presence

When enabled, the bot backs off if staff members are actively responding to a ticket. It waits 5 minutes after the last staff message before suggesting again.

### Outside Business Hours Only

Only provide AI suggestions when no staff are available (outside your configured business hours). Useful if you want humans to handle tickets during work hours.

## Feedback System

The feedback system helps your bot learn and improve over time.

### How It Works

When your bot suggests an answer, users see thumbs up/down buttons:
- 👍 **Helpful** - The answer was useful
- 👎 **Not Helpful** - The answer wasn't relevant or correct

The bot uses this feedback to improve future suggestions.

### Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Enable Feedback** | Show vote buttons on suggestions |
| **Staff Only Voting** | Only count votes from staff members |
| **Self-Learning** | Automatically adjust content ranking based on votes |

### Self-Learning

When enabled, the bot automatically:
- **Boosts** content that gets positive feedback (shown more often)
- **Penalizes** content that gets negative feedback (shown less often)

This happens after a minimum number of votes (default: 3) to avoid acting on outliers.

## Escalation

When the AI doesn't have a good answer, it can automatically escalate to your team.

### Auto-Escalation

When enabled, the bot will:
1. Detect when it can't find a confident answer
2. Notify your staff team
3. Let users know a human will help them

### Human Assistance Detection

The bot understands when users want to talk to a human. Phrases like:
- "I want to speak to someone"
- "Can I talk to a real person?"
- "Human please"

Will trigger immediate escalation to your team.

## The /train Command

The `/train` command lets you teach your bot from historical ticket conversations.

### How It Works

1. Run `/train` in your Discord server
2. Choose how many days of history to analyze (default: 90 days)
3. The bot scans resolved tickets and learns Q&A pairs
4. This knowledge is added to your Knowledge Base

<Info>
  Only administrators can use the `/train` command.
</Info>

### When to Use It

- When first setting up Knowledge Base
- After resolving many new types of issues
- To capture tribal knowledge from your team

### AI Consent

The first time you run `/train`, you'll be asked to accept AI data processing terms. This is required because:
- Ticket conversations are sent to AI for analysis
- The AI extracts question-answer pairs
- These pairs are stored in your Knowledge Base

Only the bot owner can accept these terms.

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Not Suggesting Answers

1. **Check if enabled** - Make sure Knowledge Base is toggled on
2. **Check sources** - At least one source should be indexed (green status)
3. **Lower confidence** - Try lowering the confidence threshold to 50%
4. **Check triggers** - Make sure "On Ticket Creation" is enabled

### Indexing Failed

1. **Check the URL** - Make sure the page is publicly accessible
2. **Try again** - Sometimes pages are temporarily unavailable
3. **Check page size** - Very large pages (50,000+ characters) may be trimmed

### Wrong Answers

1. **Check source content** - Make sure your documentation is accurate
2. **Add better sources** - More specific documentation helps
3. **Use categories** - Limit which tickets can use each source
4. **Enable feedback** - Let users vote to improve suggestions
