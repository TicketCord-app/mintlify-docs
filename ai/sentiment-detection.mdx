Sentiment Detection uses AI to analyze the emotional tone of customer messages. When a customer is frustrated, angry, or upset, your team can be alerted immediately.

<Info>
  Sentiment Detection is a **Pro** feature. [Upgrade your plan](https://ticketcord.net/pricing) to access it.
</Info>

## How It Works

1. Customer sends a message
2. AI analyzes the emotional tone
3. If a concerning sentiment is detected, staff is notified
4. Staff can respond appropriately

**Example:**
> Customer: "This is ridiculous! I've been waiting 3 days and STILL no response!!"
>
> AI detects: **Frustrated** / **Angry**
>
> Staff gets pinged: "⚠️ Frustrated customer in #ticket-12345"

## Detected Sentiments

| Sentiment | Description | Typical Signs |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Angry** | Strong negative emotion | ALL CAPS, profanity, threats |
| **Frustrated** | Persistent dissatisfaction | Repeated complaints, exasperation |
| **Upset** | General unhappiness | Disappointment, sadness |
| **Confused** | Uncertainty or misunderstanding | Questions, "I don't understand" |
| **Happy** | Positive emotions | Thank yous, exclamations of joy |
| **Neutral** | No strong emotion | Factual statements |

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Sentiment Detection">
    Go to **AI Features** → **Sentiment Detection** and toggle it on.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Actions">
    Configure what happens when each sentiment is detected.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign Roles">
    Choose which roles get notified for each sentiment.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tone Actions

For each sentiment, you can configure an action:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Ping Role** | Notify a specific role when detected |
| **Do Nothing** | Track the sentiment but don't notify |

### Example Setup

| Sentiment | Action | Role |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Angry | Ping Role | @Senior Support |
| Frustrated | Ping Role | @Support Team |
| Upset | Ping Role | @Support Team |
| Confused | Do Nothing | - |
| Happy | Do Nothing | - |
| Neutral | Do Nothing | - |

<Tip>
  Only ping for negative sentiments to avoid notification fatigue.
</Tip>

## Settings

### Analysis Mode

When to analyze sentiment:

| Mode | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **First Message** | Analyze immediately | Quick detection |
| **First 5 Messages** | Wait for more context | Better accuracy |
| **Smart Detection** | AI decides timing | Recommended |

**Smart Detection** waits if:
- Staff is actively responding
- More context would help
- Message is ambiguous

### Delay Before Analysis

Seconds to wait before analyzing:
- **0** - Immediate
- **15-30** - Let user finish typing
- **60+** - Wait for multi-message context

## What AI Looks For

### Language Signals

| Signal | Sentiment |
|--------|-----------|
| ALL CAPS | Angry/Frustrated |
| Exclamation marks!!! | Strong emotion |
| Question marks??? | Confused |
| Thank you, great! | Happy |
| "I don't understand" | Confused |
| Profanity | Angry |

### Context Clues

- **Repeated issues** → Frustrated
- **Waiting mentions** → Frustrated/Upset
- **Threats to leave** → Angry
- **Compliments** → Happy
- **Neutral facts** → Neutral

### Combination Detection

AI considers multiple signals together:
```
"This is the THIRD time I'm asking!!"
     ↓
Repeated issue (frustrated) + CAPS (angry) + !! (strong emotion)
     ↓
Result: Frustrated (primary) + Angry (secondary)
```

## How Staff Sees It

When concerning sentiment is detected:

```
⚠️ Sentiment Alert: Frustrated Customer

Ticket: #ticket-12345
Customer: John Smith
Sentiment: Frustrated (87% confidence)

"I've been waiting for 3 days with no response"
```

Staff can:
- Click to open the ticket
- See the confidence level
- Review the triggering message

## Best Practices

### Respond Appropriately

When alerted to negative sentiment:

**Do:**
- Acknowledge their frustration
- Apologize for the experience
- Offer a solution quickly
- Escalate if needed

**Don't:**
- Be defensive
- Ignore the sentiment
- Use generic responses
- Keep them waiting longer

### Train Your Team

Help staff handle different sentiments:
- **Angry** → Stay calm, empathize, escalate if needed
- **Frustrated** → Acknowledge, explain, resolve quickly
- **Confused** → Clarify, guide step-by-step
- **Upset** → Empathize, offer solution

### Combine with Other Features

Sentiment Detection works well with:

**Priority Detection:**
```
Angry + High Priority → Immediate escalation
```

**Auto-Routing:**
```
Frustrated customers → Senior support
```

**Knowledge Base:**
```
Adjust AI tone when sentiment is negative
```

## Troubleshooting

### Not Detecting Sentiment

1. **Check if enabled** - Verify Sentiment Detection is on
2. **Check analysis mode** - "Smart Detection" may wait
3. **Check message content** - Very short messages may not have enough signals

### Wrong Sentiment Detected

1. **Context matters** - Sarcasm and irony are hard to detect
2. **Cultural differences** - Some expressions vary by culture
3. **Ambiguous messages** - Short messages may be misread

### Too Many Alerts

1. **Adjust actions** - Set some sentiments to "Do Nothing"
2. **Increase delay** - Wait longer before analyzing
3. **Use Smart Detection** - Let AI decide when to alert

### Missed Angry Customers

1. **Lower sensitivity** - Some expressions are subtle
2. **Check action config** - Make sure "Angry" has an action
3. **Check role config** - Verify the notification role exists

## Privacy Note

Sentiment Detection analyzes message content to detect emotional tone. It does not:
- Store sentiment history long-term
- Share data with third parties
- Use data for purposes other than detection
