## How AI Works

All AI features use the same general workflow:

1. **Trigger** - Something happens (ticket created, message sent, etc.)
2. **Analyze** - AI reads the content and understands context
3. **Action** - AI takes an action (suggest answer, route ticket, etc.)
4. **Learn** - Feedback improves future accuracy

### AI Tokens

AI features use tokens - think of them as the "fuel" for AI operations. Each plan includes a monthly token allowance:

| Plan | Monthly Tokens | Approximate Uses |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| Pro | 10 million | ~2,000-5,000 AI operations |
| Enterprise | 30 million | ~6,000-15,000 AI operations |

<Tip>
  Tokens reset on the 1st of each month. You can monitor usage in **AI Features** → **Usage Overview**.
</Tip>

### What Uses Tokens?

| Feature | Token Usage |
|---------|-------------|
| Knowledge Base suggestion | ~500-2,000 tokens |
| Auto-routing analysis | ~200-500 tokens |
| Priority detection | ~200-500 tokens |
| Duplicate detection | ~300-800 tokens |
| Translation | ~100-500 tokens |
| Sentiment detection | ~100-300 tokens |
| Atlas AI query | ~500-3,000 tokens |

<Info>
  Actual token usage varies based on message length and complexity.

## Enabling AI Features

Each AI feature can be enabled independently:

1. Go to your bot's dashboard
2. Select your server
3. Click **AI Features** in the sidebar
4. Toggle on the features you want

You don't have to use all features - enable only what you need.

## Best Practices

### Start Small

Don't enable everything at once:
1. Start with one feature (like Knowledge Base)
2. Test it thoroughly
3. Add more features once you're comfortable

### Monitor Usage

Check your token usage regularly:
- **AI Features** → **Usage Overview** shows current usage
- Set up alerts if you're approaching limits
- Consider upgrading if you consistently hit limits

### Combine Features

AI features work well together:
- **Priority Detection** + **Auto-Routing** = High-priority tickets go to senior staff
- **Knowledge Base** + **Sentiment Detection** = Calm AI responses for frustrated users
- **Translation** + **Knowledge Base** = AI answers in the user's language

### Review and Adjust

AI isn't perfect out of the box:
- Check suggestion quality regularly
- Adjust confidence thresholds based on results
- Update your Knowledge Base sources as documentation changes
