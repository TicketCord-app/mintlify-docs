Translation uses AI to automatically translate messages between different languages. Your team can support customers worldwide without needing multilingual staff.

<Info>
  Translation is a **Pro** feature. [Upgrade your plan](https://ticketcord.net/pricing) to access it.
</Info>

## How It Works

1. Customer sends a message in their language
2. AI detects the language automatically
3. Message is translated for staff
4. Staff replies are translated back for the customer

**Example:**
> Customer (Spanish): "Hola, necesito ayuda con mi cuenta"
>
> Staff sees: "Hello, I need help with my account" [Translated from Spanish]
>
> Staff replies: "Sure, I can help. What's the issue?"
>
> Customer sees: "Claro, puedo ayudar. ¿Cuál es el problema?"

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Translation">
    Go to **AI Features** → **Translation** and toggle it on.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Staff Language">
    Choose the language your staff works in (usually English).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Mode">
    Choose how translations should work (auto-detect recommended).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Translation Modes

| Mode | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Auto-Detect** | Automatically detects and translates any language | Most setups |
| **Customer to Staff** | Only translate customer messages | When staff are multilingual |
| **Staff to Customer** | Only translate staff messages | When customers expect translated replies |
| **Bidirectional** | Translate both ways | Full automatic translation |

<Tip>
  **Auto-Detect with Bidirectional** is recommended for most teams.
</Tip>

## Supported Languages

Translation supports 15+ languages including:

| Common | Asian | European |
|--------|-------|----------|
| English | Japanese | German |
| Spanish | Chinese | French |
| Portuguese | Korean | Italian |
| | Hindi | Russian |
| | Arabic | Dutch |

## Settings

### Staff Language

Set the primary language your team uses:
- Messages TO staff are translated to this language
- Messages FROM staff are translated to the customer's detected language

### Auto-Detect Threshold

Minimum confidence for language detection (0-100%):
- **80%+ (default)** - Only translate when confident about the language
- **60-80%** - Translate more often, may occasionally misdetect

### Display Mode

How translated messages appear:

| Mode | How It Works |
|------|--------------|
| **Embed Replace** | Translated text replaces original in an embed |
| **Reply Preserve** | Bot replies with translation, keeps original visible |
| **Smart Auto** | Chooses best display based on message length |

<Tip>
  **Reply Preserve** is useful when you want to see the original text alongside the translation.
</Tip>

### Translation Delay

Seconds to wait before translating:
- **0** - Immediate translation
- **2-5** - Wait for user to finish typing
- **10+** - For users who send multiple messages

## Filters

Skip translation for certain content:

| Filter | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Short Messages** | Skip very short messages | On (10 chars min) |
| **Code Blocks** | Don't translate code | On |
| **Commands** | Don't translate bot commands | On |
| **Emoji Only** | Don't translate pure emoji messages | On |
| **Links Only** | Don't translate URL-only messages | On |

### Custom Skip Patterns

Add custom patterns to skip translation:
- Product names that shouldn't be translated
- Technical terms
- Abbreviations

## Quality Settings

### Confidence Threshold

Minimum confidence for showing translation:
- **70%+ (default)** - Only show confident translations
- Lower values may show lower-quality translations

### Review Threshold

When confidence is below this, flag for human review:
- Staff sees the translation but with a warning
- Useful for catching potential mistranslations

### Max Message Length

Maximum characters to translate per message:
- Very long messages may be split
- Default is 4000 characters

## Notifications

Configure when to notify staff:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **On Translation** | Notify when a message is translated |
| **On Detection Failure** | Notify when language can't be detected |
| **On Low Confidence** | Notify when translation confidence is low |

## How Staff Sees Translations

When a customer message is translated, staff sees:

```
John: Hello, I need help with my account

🌐 Translated from Spanish (95% confidence)
Original: "Hola, necesito ayuda con mi cuenta"
```

Staff can:
- See the original text
- Know the source language
- See translation confidence

## Accuracy Tips

### Context Matters

AI translates better with context:
- Complete sentences translate better than fragments
- Proper grammar helps accuracy
- Avoid excessive abbreviations

### Technical Terms

Some terms shouldn't be translated:
- Product names
- Technical jargon
- Use the skip patterns feature

### Regional Variations

AI uses standard language versions:
- Spanish = Castilian Spanish (adaptable)
- Portuguese = Brazilian Portuguese (most common)
- Chinese = Simplified Chinese (default)

## Troubleshooting

### Message Not Translated

1. **Check language** - Is it a supported language?
2. **Check filters** - Is the message being filtered?
3. **Check length** - Is it too short?
4. **Check confidence** - Is detection confident enough?

### Wrong Language Detected

1. **Check message content** - Mixed languages confuse detection
2. **Lower threshold** - But may cause more errors
3. **Let users specify** - Consider a language field in ticket forms

### Poor Translation Quality

1. **Check original** - Is the original text clear?
2. **Check length** - Very short phrases may lack context
3. **Report issues** - Note problematic translations for review

### High Token Usage

Translation uses AI tokens. To reduce usage:
1. **Enable filters** - Skip short messages, code, etc.
2. **Raise threshold** - Only translate confident detections
3. **One direction** - Use "Customer to Staff" if staff are multilingual
