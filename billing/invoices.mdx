## Refunds
### Requesting a Refund
To request a refund, contact us at hi@ticketcord.net with:
- Your account email

### EU Withdrawal Rights
Under EU law (Directive 2011/83/EU), consumers have a 14-day withdrawal right for digital goods. However, since TicketCord provides **immediate access** to premium features upon purchase, you are asked to waive this right during checkout. Once you consent and your subscription begins, it is non-refundable.

If you did not waive this right during checkout and have not used any paid features, you may still be eligible for withdrawal within 14 days. Contact us at hi@ticketcord.net with your invoice details.

See our [Terms of Service](https://ticketcord.net/terms) for full details.

### Refund Processing

- Refunds are processed to your original payment method
- Processing time: 5-10 business days
- Partial refunds may be issued for prorated periods

## Tax Information

### VAT for EU Customers

- VAT is charged based on your country of residence
- Businesses with valid VAT IDs may be exempt
- VAT amounts are shown separately on invoices

### Tax Receipts

All invoices serve as tax receipts and include:

- Tax amounts (where applicable)
