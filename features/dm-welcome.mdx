## Delivery Options

### Timing

Configure when the message sends:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Immediate** | Send as soon as they join |
| **Delayed** | Wait X seconds/minutes |

<Tip>
  A small delay (10-30 seconds) can feel more natural than instant messages.
</Tip>

### Conditions

Optionally send only if:

- Member accepts rules (if using Discord's rules screening)
- Member has verified email
- Member is not a bot

## Handling Failures

### Why DMs Might Fail

DMs can fail to deliver if:

- User has DMs disabled from server members
- User blocked the bot
- Discord rate limits

### Fallback Options

When DM fails:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **None** | Do nothing |
| **Channel Message** | Post in a channel instead |
| **Log** | Record failure for review |

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Keep It Brief**
  Long messages feel overwhelming. Stick to essentials.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Be Helpful**
  Include useful links: rules, FAQ, support channel.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Don't Spam**
  One welcome message is enough. Avoid multiple messages.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Test It**
  Send yourself a test message to verify formatting.
</Tip>
