title: "Auto-Close on User Leave"
description: "Automatically close tickets when the user leaves your server"
---
Automatically close tickets when the ticket creator leaves, is kicked, or is banned from your Discord server.

## Why Use This Feature?

When a user leaves your server:

- They can no longer respond to their ticket
- Tickets become unresolvable
- Open tickets clutter your queue
- Staff time is wasted on abandoned tickets

Auto-close on user leave solves this by:

- Detecting when ticket creators leave
- Automatically closing their tickets
- Optionally saving transcripts
- Keeping your ticket queue clean

## How It Works

```
User Leaves Server

System Detects Leave
       ↓
Finds User's Open Tickets
       ↓
Closes Tickets
       ↓
Optionally: Generates Transcripts
       ↓
Optionally: Deletes Channels
```

## Configuration Options

### Basic Settings

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Enabled** | Turn feature on/off |
| **Generate Transcript** | Save transcript before closing |
| **Delete Channel** | Remove Discord channel |
| **Delay** | Wait X minutes before closing |

### Close Message

Customize the closure message in the ticket:

```
This ticket has been automatically closed because 
{{user}} is no longer a member of this server.
```

### Transcript Options

If generating transcripts:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Auto-Generate** | Always create transcript |
| **Store** | Save to transcript storage |
| **Send to Logs** | Post in log channel |

## Trigger Events

The feature triggers when a user:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Leaves** | User voluntarily leaves server |
| **Kicked** | User is kicked by staff |
| **Banned** | User is banned from server |

All events trigger ticket closure by default.

### Configuring Events

You can enable/disable specific triggers:

- Leave: Close when user leaves voluntarily
- Kick: Close when user is kicked
- Ban: Close when user is banned

## Notification Options

### Ticket Closure Embed

When a ticket is auto-closed, an embed is posted:

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════╗
║  🔒 Ticket Closed                     ║
╠═══════════════════════════════════════╣
║  This ticket was automatically closed ║
║  because the user left the server.    ║
║                                       ║
║  Reason: User Left                    ║
║  Time: January 15, 2026 3:45 PM       ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════╝
```

### Log Channel

Optionally log auto-closures:

- Send notification to log channel
- Include ticket details
- Track closure reasons

## Multiple Tickets

If a user has multiple open tickets:

- All their tickets are closed
- Each gets its own closure message
- Transcripts generated for each (if enabled)
- Processed sequentially to avoid rate limits

## Delay Option

### Why Use a Delay?

- User might rejoin quickly
- Accidental disconnects happen
- Gives grace period

### How Delay Works

1. User leaves server
2. System waits configured delay (e.g., 5 minutes)
3. If user hasn't rejoined, tickets close
4. If user rejoins, nothing happens

### Configuring Delay

| Delay | Best For |
|-------|----------|
| 0 (Immediate) | Permanent closures |
| 5 minutes | Quick rejoin grace |
| 30 minutes | Longer grace period |

## Staff Tickets

### What Happens to Staff?

If a staff member leaves:

- Their tickets remain open (if they created any)
- Tickets they're assigned to are unassigned
- Configurable behavior

### Staff Leave Options

| Option | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Treat as User** | Close their tickets |
| **Keep Open** | Don't auto-close staff tickets |
| **Unassign Only** | Remove from assigned tickets |

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Enable Transcripts**
  Save transcripts before closing for record-keeping.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use Short Delay**
  5-minute delay handles accidental disconnects without stale tickets.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Log Closures**
  Track auto-closures in your log channel for awareness.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Review Settings**
  Periodically check if settings match your support needs.
</Tip>

## Interaction with Other Features

### Auto-Close Timer

If both auto-close on leave AND timed auto-close are enabled:

- User leave triggers immediate closure (or after delay)
- Takes precedence over timed auto-close

### SLA

When ticket is auto-closed due to user leaving:

- SLA timer stops
- Not counted as breach (user unavailable)
- Marked as special closure reason
