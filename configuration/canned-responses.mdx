## What Are Canned Responses?

Canned responses are pre-written templates that staff can quickly use when responding to tickets. They help:

- **Save Time**: No need to type the same thing repeatedly
- **Ensure Consistency**: Same quality answers every time
- **Reduce Errors**: Pre-approved responses are accurate
- **Train New Staff**: Templates show best practices

## Sharing Responses

### Per-Server

- Staff sees responses for current server

### Copying Between Servers

To use the same responses across servers:

1. Export from source server
2. Import to target server
3. Adjust server-specific content

## Analytics

Track response usage:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Times Used** | How often response is used |
| **Last Used** | When it was last used |
| **Popular** | Most frequently used |

Use this to:

- Identify most common questions
- Update outdated responses
- Create new responses for gaps
