## What is SLA Management?

Service Level Agreements (SLAs) define:

- **Response time targets** - How quickly to respond
- **Resolution time targets** - How quickly to resolve
- **Escalation rules** - What happens if targets are missed
- **Compliance tracking** - Monitor performance against targets

## Setting Up SLAs

### Creating an SLA Policy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to SLA Settings">
    Dashboard → Configuration → SLA Management
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Create Policy">
    Select **Create New SLA Policy**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name Your Policy">
    Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Standard Support")
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Targets">
    Set response and resolution time goals
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Escalation">
    What happens when targets are missed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Policy">
    Policy is now active
  </Step>
</Steps>

## SLA Targets

### Response Time

Time until first staff reply:

| Priority | Example Target |
|----------|---------------|
| Urgent | 15 minutes |
| High | 1 hour |
| Medium | 4 hours |
| Low | 24 hours |

### Resolution Time

Time until ticket is closed:

| Priority | Example Target |
|----------|---------------|
| Urgent | 4 hours |
| High | 8 hours |
| Medium | 24 hours |
| Low | 72 hours |

### Configuring Targets

For each priority level, set:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Target Time** | Hours/minutes to meet |
| **Warning Threshold** | When to show warning (e.g., 75%) |
| **Breach Threshold** | When SLA is breached (100%) |

## Business Hours

SLA timers can respect business hours:

### Setting Business Hours

1. Go to Configuration → Business Hours
2. Define your operating schedule
3. Set timezone
4. Add holidays (optional)

### Example Schedule

| Day | Hours |
|-----|-------|
| Monday-Friday | 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM |
| Saturday | 10:00 AM - 2:00 PM |
| Sunday | Closed |

### Timer Behavior

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **24/7** | Timer runs continuously |
| **Business Hours** | Timer pauses outside hours |
| **Hybrid** | Different rules per priority |

<Tip>
  For urgent tickets, consider 24/7 SLA. For low priority, business hours is often appropriate.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Start Conservative**
  Set achievable targets initially. Tighten as you improve.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Differentiate by Priority**
  Not every ticket needs a 1-hour response. Match targets to importance.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use Business Hours**
  Avoid overnight breaches by setting appropriate business hours.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Review Regularly**
  Analyze SLA data monthly to identify improvement opportunities.
