### Workflow Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Stages** | Steps in the approval process |
| **Approvers** | Who can approve each stage |
| **Triggers** | What starts the workflow |
| **Actions** | What happens after approval/rejection |
| **Timeouts** | Auto-escalation if not acted on |

## Configuring Stages

### Adding Stages

Each workflow can have multiple stages:

1. Click **Add Stage**
2. Enter stage name (e.g., "Manager Review")
3. Select approvers (roles or specific users)
4. Set approval rules (any one, all required, majority)
5. Configure timeout (optional)

### Stage Order

Stages execute sequentially:

```
Stage 1 → Stage 2 → Stage 3 → Complete
```

Each stage must be approved before the next begins.

### Approval Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Any One** | Any single approver can approve |
| **All Required** | Every approver must approve |
| **Majority** | More than half must approve |
| **Specific Count** | Minimum number of approvals |

## Setting Approvers

### By Role

Select Discord roles that can approve:

- All users with that role can approve
- Useful for teams (e.g., @Managers)
- Role changes automatically reflected

### By User

Select specific users:

- Named individuals
- Useful for single points of authority
- Must update if person changes

<Tip>
  Use role-based approvers when possible for easier maintenance.
</Tip>

## Workflow Triggers

### Automatic Triggers

Workflows can start automatically when:

| Trigger | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Category** | Ticket is in specific category |
| **Tag** | Ticket has specific tag |
| **Priority** | Ticket is high/urgent priority |
| **Keyword** | Message contains keywords |
| **Close Request** | User requests closure |

### Manual Triggers

Staff can manually request approval:

- Use `/approval request` command
- Select workflow from dropdown
- Workflow begins for that ticket

## The Approval Process

### For Approvers

When a ticket needs approval:

1. Approvers receive a notification
2. Ticket shows "Pending Approval" status
3. Approvers can view ticket details
4. Click **Approve** or **Reject**
5. Add optional comments

### Approval Controls

In the ticket, approvers see:

- Current stage name
- Who needs to approve
- Time waiting
- Approve/Reject buttons
- Comment field

### Status Tracking

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Pending** | Waiting for approval |
| **Approved** | Stage approved, moving to next |
| **Rejected** | Request denied |
| **Expired** | Timeout reached |
| **Completed** | All stages approved |

## Actions After Approval

### On Approval

Configure what happens when approved:

- Close the ticket
- Move to different category
- Assign to specific user
- Send notification
- Execute custom action

### On Rejection

Configure rejection behavior:

- Keep ticket open
- Send message to creator
- Assign for follow-up
- Log rejection reason

## Timeouts & Escalation

### Setting Timeouts

For each stage, optionally configure:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Timeout Duration** | Hours/days before timeout |
| **Timeout Action** | What happens on timeout |
| **Reminder** | Notification before timeout |

### Timeout Actions

When a stage times out:

- **Auto-approve**: Proceed to next stage
- **Auto-reject**: Reject the request
- **Escalate**: Notify higher authority
- **Remind**: Send another notification

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Keep It Simple**
  Start with 1-2 stage workflows. Add complexity only when needed.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Set Reasonable Timeouts**
  24-48 hours for most approvals prevents bottlenecks.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use Role-Based Approvers**
  Easier to maintain when staff changes.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Document Your Workflows**
  Help staff understand when and why approvals are needed.
</Tip>

## Managing Workflows

### Editing Workflows

1. Go to Approval Workflows settings
2. Click on the workflow to edit
3. Make changes
4. Save

<Note>
  Changes don't affect tickets already in the workflow.
</Note>

### Disabling Workflows

- Toggle workflow off to pause
- Existing tickets complete with old rules
- New tickets won't trigger the workflow

### Deleting Workflows

<Warning>
  Deleting a workflow cancels all pending approvals using it.
</Warning>

## Viewing Approval History

Track approval activity:

- All approvals in audit log
- Filter by workflow, approver, outcome
- Export for compliance reporting
