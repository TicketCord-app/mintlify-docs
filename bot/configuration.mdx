## Setup Flow Overview

After adding your bot and inviting it to your server, follow this process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run /setup in Discord">
    Creates the basic Discord infrastructure (categories and roles)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete configuration on dashboard">
    Select the created resources and configure all features
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create ticket embeds">
    Build embeds with buttons that users click to open tickets
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 1: Run /setup Command

In your Discord server, run the setup command:

```
/setup
```

<Info>
  You need **Administrator** permission or **Manage Channels** + **Manage Roles** permissions to run this command.
</Info>

This command creates:

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 🎫 Tickets | Category where new tickets are created |
| 📁 Closed Tickets | Category where closed tickets are moved |
| Ticket Admin | Role with full ticket management access |
| Ticket Support | Role with basic ticket access |

<Warning>
  The `/setup` command only creates Discord resources. You **must** complete the configuration on the dashboard for your bot to work.
</Warning>

### Handling Existing Resources

If `/setup` detects existing ticket categories or roles, you'll see options to:

- **Create Anyway** - Creates new resources with unique names
- **Use Existing** - Skip creation and configure existing resources on the dashboard

## Step 2: Dashboard Configuration

After running `/setup`, go to [ticketcord.net/dashboard](https://ticketcord.net/dashboard) to complete the setup:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select your bot and server">
    Choose the bot and server you just set up
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Essential Settings">
    - **Ticket Category** - Select the 🎫 Tickets category
    - **Closed Category** - Select the 📁 Closed Tickets category
    - **Staff Roles** - Select the Admin and Support roles created by `/setup`
    - **Log Channel** - Choose where ticket events are logged (optional)
    - **Transcript Channel** - Choose where transcripts are saved (optional)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign roles to your staff">
    In Discord, give your team members the Ticket Admin or Ticket Support roles
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Create Ticket Embeds

Ticket embeds are messages with buttons that users click to open tickets. *(Sometimes called "panels" in other bots)*

1. Go to **Embeds** in the dashboard
2. Click **Create Embed**
3. Design your embed using the builder
4. Add a button with the **Open Ticket** action
5. Send to your desired channel (e.g., #support)

<Tip>
  You can create multiple embeds for different ticket types (support, sales, applications, etc.) by using different ticket categories.
</Tip>
