## Error Codes

When something goes wrong, TicketCord displays an error code to help identify the issue. Find your error code below for solutions.

### TC001 - Rate Limited

**What it means:** Discord is temporarily blocking requests because too many actions were performed too quickly.

**Common causes:**
- Closing/reopening tickets rapidly
- Renaming many ticket channels in a short time
- Pinning/unpinning tickets quickly
- Discord limits channel edits to 2 per 10 minutes

**Solution:** Wait 5-10 minutes and try again. This is a Discord limitation, not a TicketCord issue.

<Tip>
  When you hit this limit, TicketCord will still save your changes (like pinning a ticket). The visual update (channel name change) will be applied automatically once the rate limit resets.
</Tip>

### TC002 - Permission Denied

**What it means:** The bot lacks the required permissions to perform the action.

**Common causes:**
- Bot role is below other roles in the hierarchy
- Bot missing channel-specific permissions
- Category permissions override bot permissions

**Solution:**
1. Go to **Server Settings → Roles**
2. Drag the bot's role **above** the staff roles
3. Ensure the bot has these permissions: Manage Channels, Manage Roles, Send Messages, Embed Links, Attach Files, Read Message History

<Warning>
  If you invited the bot manually instead of through the dashboard, permissions may be incorrectly configured. Use the dashboard invite link to fix this.
</Warning>

**What it means:** A channel, category, or role that TicketCord needs no longer exists.

- Ticket category was deleted

### TC008 - Failed to Fetch Resources

**Common causes:**
