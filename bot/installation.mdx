## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

- A Discord account
- **Manage Server** permission on your target server
- A Discord bot application (we'll create this below)

## Create a Discord Application

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Discord Developer Portal">
    Visit [discord.dev](https://discord.dev) and sign in.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create New Application">
    Click **New Application**, enter a name, and click **Create**.

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Bot User">
    Go to the **Bot** tab and click **Add Bot**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Disable Public Bot">
    In the **Bot** tab, find **Public Bot** and **turn it OFF** (toggle should be gray, not blue). This prevents others from adding your bot to their servers.

    <Warning>
      Make sure the toggle is **disabled** (gray). The image below shows where to find it - click the toggle to turn it off.
    </Warning>

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/PublicBot.png" alt="Disable public bot setting" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Privileged Gateway Intents">
    TicketCord automatically enables all required **Privileged Gateway Intents** when your bot connects.

    <Warning>
      Do not manually change any intent settings. Disabling intents will break your bot's functionality.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy Bot Token">
    Click **Reset Token** and copy the token. You'll need this for TicketCord.

    <Warning>
      Keep your token secret! Anyone with your token has full control of your bot.
    </Warning>

    <Info>
      If you reset your token after adding the bot to TicketCord, your bot will go offline. To fix this, go to your bot in the dashboard and click **Update Credentials** to enter the new token. The bot will automatically restart once updated.
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Connect to TicketCord

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign in to Dashboard">
    Go to [ticketcord.net/dashboard](https://ticketcord.net/dashboard) and sign in with Discord.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Custom Bot">
    Click **Add Bot** and enter your credentials:
    - **Client ID** - Found in your Discord application's General Information
    - **Client Secret** - Found in your Discord application's OAuth2 settings
    - **Bot Token** - The token you copied earlier

    <Info>
      TicketCord will automatically configure your bot's intents and settings during validation.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Validate & Create">
    Click **Validate & Continue**. TicketCord will verify your credentials and display your bot's information. Review and click **Create Bot** to finish.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Invite to Server">
    From your bot's dashboard, click **Invite** and select your server. This ensures all required permissions are configured correctly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Required Permissions

TicketCord bots need these permissions to function properly:

| Permission | Reason |
|------------|--------|
| Manage Channels | Create and delete ticket channels |
| Manage Roles | Manage ticket access permissions |
| Send Messages | Send ticket messages and responses |
| Embed Links | Send rich embed messages |
| Attach Files | Send transcripts and attachments |
| Read Message History | Read ticket conversations |
| Add Reactions | Add reactions to messages |
| Use External Emojis | Use custom emoji in embeds |

<Info>
  When you invite your bot through the TicketCord dashboard, all required permissions are **automatically configured** for you.
</Info>

<Warning>
  **Do not invite your bot manually** through Discord's developer portal. Manual invites may result in incorrect permissions, causing features like ticket creation, transcripts, or role management to fail.
</Warning>
