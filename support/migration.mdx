5. **Test before switching**: Ensure parity

## Handling Historical Data

### Your Old Tickets

TicketCord cannot import tickets from other bots because:

- Different data formats
- No standardized export
- Privacy considerations

### Recommendations

<Tip>
  **Keep Old Bot Running (Temporarily)**
  Run both bots briefly so you can reference old tickets if needed.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Export Transcripts**
  If your old bot supports it, export transcripts before removing.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Screenshot Important Info**
  Capture any critical ticket information manually.
</Tip>

## Parallel Running

### Safe Transition

Run both bots simultaneously during transition:

1. Set up TicketCord in test channels
2. Train staff on new system
3. Gradually direct users to new system
4. Monitor for issues
5. Remove old bot when confident

### Avoiding Conflicts

- Use different channels for each bot
- Clearly label which is which
- Set old bot to read-only if possible

## Staff Training

### What's Different

Educate your team on:

| Old Way | TicketCord Way |
|---------|----------------|
| Bot commands | Dashboard + commands |
| Text transcripts | Web-based transcripts |
| Manual stats | Analytics dashboard |
| No AI | AI suggestions (Pro+) |

### Training Resources

- Share this documentation
- Create channel for questions
- Run practice sessions
- Document server-specific workflows

## Announcing the Change

### Communication Plan

1. **Before switch**: Announce upcoming change
2. **Transition day**: Clear instructions
3. **After switch**: Address questions

### Example Announcement
